(** * Coq typeclass resolution is Turing-complete

    by Thalia Archibald, 15 Apr 2023

    The Coq theorem prover has a powerful means of abstraction, typeclasses. To
    resolve a typeclass instance, Coq performs an unrestricted proof search for
    a satisfying instance. This proof search can be seen as the trace of a
    program execution and, when no such instance exists, it diverges. This
    indicates it should be Turing-complete! Let's prove it! *)

(** ** Background on typeclasses

    A typeclass is essentially an interface associated with a type.

    Typeclasses were first introduced in Haskell and have since been adopted by
    many other languages, including in Rust as traits. With its richer dependent
    types, Coq further extends typeclasses to allow for values in constraints.
    This allows for computation to be mixed with the search for an instance.

    For a more in-depth tutorial on typeclasses, see the
    #<a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/qc-current/Typeclasses.html">
    Typeclasses</a># chapter in the fantastic Software Foundations series. The
    section on non-termination and the advice from experts are particularly
    relevant to this. *)

(** ** Smallfuck

    To prove Turing-completeness, it is sufficient to implement a
    Turing-complete language.

    I model the semantics of #<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Smallfuck">
    Smallfuck</a>#, a subset of Brainfuck, using typeclass instances. Smallfuck
    has a tape of bits and can move the cell pointer left or right, flip the
    current cell, and loop. I/O and a more complex cell type are not needed to
    demonstrate Turing-completeness, but you could see how that would be
    modelled in my #<a href="https://github.com/thaliaarchi/bfcoq">bfcoq</a>#
    project. *)

(** [prog] represents a Smallfuck program:

    - [PRight] ([>]) moves the tape right
    - [PLeft] ([<]) moves the tape left
    - [PFlip] ([*]) flips the current cell
    - [PLoop] ([[…]]) repeats while the current cell is 1
    - [PEnd] is a no-op used at the end of a loop or program *)

Inductive prog : Type :=
  | PRight (next : prog)
  | PLeft (next : prog)
  | PFlip (next : prog)
  | PLoop (body next : prog)
  | PEnd.

(** [tape] is an infinite tape, where [cell] is the current cell and [ltape] and
    [rtape] are the cells to the left and right, respectively. *)

Record tape : Type := Tape {
  cell : bool;
  ltape : list bool;
  rtape : list bool;
}.

(** Let's define a shorthand for booleans. *)

Local Notation "0" := false.
Local Notation "1" := true.

(** ** Small-step semantics

    To execute a Smallfuck program, we map an initial tape to a final tape. I
    model this as a typeclass [Exec], that takes a program [p] and initial and
    final tapes [t] and [t']. It has a function [exec] that returns [t'], so it
    can be used.

    Notice that it is parameterized over _values_ [p], [t], and [t'], not types.
    Other languages only allow types as generic parameters, but Coq generalizes
    it to any dependently-typed term, values and types. *)

Class Exec (p : prog) (t t' : tape) : Type := {
  exec := t';
}.

(** I then define instances of [Exec] for each operation in big-step semantics
    style. These define the transformations to be performed in each case, and
    can be seen as a pattern matching at the instance level.

    [PEnd] is the simplest to model; it takes a tape [t] and maps it to
    itself (does nothing). Syntactically, this defines an instance named
    [Exec_End], that satisfies [Exec] for the program [PEnd] and some tape [t]
    for both the initial and final tape. *)

#[export] Instance Exec_End t :
  Exec PEnd t t := {}.

(** [PFlip] negates the current cell.

    Intuitively, this definition states that if the remainder of the program can
    be executed, then we can also execute [PFlip]. That is, if it can resolve an
    instance for the program starting after applying the flip, then it will
    supply an instance for the flip. This order is backwards, because it applies
    the operations post-order in a depth-first search.

    The parameter [`{Exec p t t'}] is a class constraint, which implicitly
    supplies evidence that [p t t'] has an instance of [Exec]. It is equivalent
    to [{E : Exec p t t'}], but where the name is not used. *)

#[export] Instance Exec_Flip p c lt rt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape (negb c) lt rt) t'} :
  Exec (PFlip p) (Tape c lt rt) t' := {}.

(** [PRight] has two cases: When the tape has at least one cell to the left,
    shift that cell to the current and the old current to the right. When the
    left tape is empty, use [0] as the new current cell.

    Here, we destructure [Tape], so we can cover the cases of [[]] and
    [_ :: _]. *)

#[export] Instance Exec_Right_cons p c lt rc rt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape rc (c :: lt) rt) t'} :
  Exec (PRight p) (Tape c lt (rc :: rt)) t' := {}.
#[export] Instance Exec_Right_nil p c lt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape 0 (c :: lt) []) t'} :
  Exec (PRight p) (Tape c lt []) t' := {}.

(** Likewise for [PLeft]. *)

#[export] Instance Exec_Left_cons p c lc lt rt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape lc lt (c :: rt)) t'} :
  Exec (PLeft p) (Tape c (lc :: lt) rt) t' := {}.
#[export] Instance Exec_Left_nil p c rt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape 0 [] (c :: rt)) t'} :
  Exec (PLeft p) (Tape c [] rt) t' := {}.

(** Finally, [PLoop] has two cases: When the current cell is [0], skip the body
    and execute the next operation. When the current cell is [1], execute the
    body, then repeat the loop.

    [Exec_Loop_1] requires two instances, for executing the body once and for
    executing the loop again. *)

#[export] Instance Exec_Loop_0 b p lt rt t'
  `{Exec p (Tape 0 lt rt) t'} :
  Exec (PLoop b p) (Tape 0 lt rt) t' := {}.
#[export] Instance Exec_Loop_1 b p lt rt t' t''
  `{Exec b (Tape 1 lt rt) t'}
  `{Exec (PLoop b p) t' t''} :
  Exec (PLoop b p) (Tape 1 lt rt) t'' := {}.

(** ** Execution

    Now let's execute programs by typechecking! First, enable typeclass
    debugging, so we can inspect the search path. *)

Set Typeclasses Debug.

(** As expected, this typechecks, because [>] shifts the tape [1(1)01] right to
    [11(0)1]: *)

Definition exec_right_verify
  `{E : Exec (PRight PEnd) (Tape 1 [1] [0; 1])
                           (Tape 0 [1; 1] [1])} := E.
Check exec_right_verify.

(** However, give it an impossible result and it cannot find an instance: *)

Definition exec_right_bad
  `{E : Exec (PRight PEnd) (Tape 1 [1] [0; 1])
                           (Tape 0 [] [])} := E.
Check exec_right_bad.

(** More usefully, we can generalize it to any tape [t] and let it infer the
    final tape after execution: *)

Definition exec_right t
  `{E : Exec (PRight PEnd) t} := E.
Check exec_right (Tape 1 [1] [0; 1]).

(** We can execute loops too, like [>*>*[*<]]: *)

Definition exec_rr_back t
  `{E : Exec (PRight (PFlip (PRight (PFlip
              (PLoop (PFlip (PLeft PEnd)) PEnd))))) t} := E.
Check exec_rr_back (Tape 0 [] [1]).

(** Non-terminating programs like [[]] and [>*[>*]] work too. For the latter, it
    cannot resolve an instance for any initial tape.

    Each iteration of the loop generates for a fresh intermediate value for the
    tape, which ensures a revisited state will not resolve to the same
    instance. *)

Definition exec_loop_nonterm
  `{E : Exec (PLoop PEnd PEnd) (Tape 1 [] [])} := E.
Fail Timeout 1 Check exec_loop_nonterm.

Definition exec_loop_r_nonterm
  `{E : Exec (PRight (PFlip (PLoop (PRight (PFlip PEnd)) PEnd)))} := E.
Fail Timeout 1 Check exec_loop_r_nonterm.

(** And finally, a program that writes “Hallo, Welt!” in binary to the tape,
    [>*>>>*>>>>>*>*>>>>>*>>*>*>>*>*>>>>*>*>>*>*>>>>*>*>>*>*>*>*>>>*>>*>*>>>
    >>*>>>>>>>*>>*>>*>*>*>>*>*>>>*>>*>>*>*>>*>*>>>>*>*>*>>*>>>>>*>>>>>*>]: *)

(** ** Conclusion

    To my knowledge, this is the first proof of the Turing-completeness of
    typeclass resolution in Coq.
